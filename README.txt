James Kun â€” Portfolio (Final)
-----------------------------
Files included:
 - index.html            (merged single-page site)
 - css/                  (placeholder CSS files; replace with original theme CSS for exact look)
 - js/                   (integration.js included; add original theme js libs for full features)
 - images/               (placeholder images; replace with your own assets)

How to use:
1. Unzip the package.
2. Replace CSS files in css/ with the original theme files (if you have them) to get the exact E-Portfolio look.
3. Add images to images/ and images/projects/ and images/tech/.
4. Commit the files to your GitHub repository root (branch 'main') and GitHub Pages will serve the site.
5. Test the contact form (it uses StaticForms; change the accessKey if needed).

Notes:
 - For full parity with the original E-Portfolio visual design, copy the original theme's css/ and js/ library files (bootstrap.min.css, main.js, owl.carousel, magnific-popup etc.) into css/ and js/ respectively.
 - integration.js uses alert() to show tech details as a lightweight modal fallback; if you keep Magnific Popup included, we can wire a nicer popup UI.
